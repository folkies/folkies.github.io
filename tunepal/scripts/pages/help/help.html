Start playing straight away. Don't wait for the countdown to complete. Tunepal works best if there is no silence at the start of the recording.</p><p>Tunepal works best with "legato" style instruments such as the tin-whistle, flute, concertina, accordion, pipes and fiddle. It doesn't work very well with "plucked string" instruments such as the banjo and harp.</p><p>To find a tune using Tunepal, first make sure you have a PC microphone connected to your computer and that your computer is capable of recording audio. You could use the Windows Sound Recorder to test this.</p><p>If your instrument uses a different "fundamental note" to the usual D (for example you are playing a a C flute) or you are playing a tune in an unusual key, then you can adjust the transcription algorithm by choosing a different "fundamental" from the <a href=#!/settings>settings</a> page.</p><p>You can filter the search results from the <a href=#!/settings>settings</a> page to limit searches to certain tunebooks or time signatures.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
